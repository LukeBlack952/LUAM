# LUAM

LUAM is a extension for HAP (formerly known as HMLP) that I made and its name stands for Lutinex Application Menu. This is a program that lets you access some of my other applications that I will be creating and that I have already created (like HAP), even the installation of the applications is done from the console. Feel free to tell me a suggestion for the program.

For now the applications which you can use are:
* HAP
